# SQL for Data Analysis – Brazilian E-Commerce (Olist Dataset)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world ecommerce data using SQL. The Brazilian E-Commerce (Olist) dataset was used to practice core SQL concepts such as filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, views, and query optimization.

The objective of this task was to demonstrate the ability to extract meaningful insights from structured data using SQL as part of an internship assignment.


## 🎯 Objective
- Perform data analysis using SQL queries
- Understand relationships between multiple tables
- Apply SQL concepts on a real world ecommerce dataset
- Create reusable views and optimize queries using indexes


## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset (Olist)
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains information about customers, orders, products, payments, and sellers from a Brazilian ecommerce platform.

### Key Tables Used
- `olist_customers_dataset`
- `olist_orders_dataset`
- `olist_order_items_dataset`
- `olist_payments_dataset`
- `olist_products_dataset`


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **SQL Tool:** DB Browser for SQLite  
- **Language:** SQL  


## 🔍 SQL Concepts Covered
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN
- Subqueries
- Views
- Indexes for query optimization


## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Identified customers based on location
- Analyzed order distribution by status
- Calculated average payment values
- Joined multiple tables to analyze sales by product category
- Identified high value orders using subqueries
- Created views for customer order summaries
- Improved query performance using indexes
